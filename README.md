# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview

Pewlett Hackard(PH) is a corporation with thousands of employees, many of whom shall soon retire. We have been asked to assist PH in determining the exact number of upcoming 
retirees in order to better prepare the company for hiring replacements. We were given six csv files with all pertinent information regarding employees and departments to use for our analysis.
With these csv files we created an ERD or Entity Relationship Diagram (as shown below) to map out the relationships between columns. We then used SQL queries via PgAdmin to create tables for the ERD 
and later for additional csv files by using inner joins via primary and foreign keys.
